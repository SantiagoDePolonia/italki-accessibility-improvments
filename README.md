# Italki accessibility improvements Chrome extension

## Introduction

This extension aims to help visually impaired people by providing basic accessibility features for italki.com using the [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) assistive technology.

Due to the lack of compliance with the [WCAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Content_Accessibility_Guidelines) standards, the website in it's current state is partially inaccessible for screenreader users.

Certain elements such as the booking calendar are completely unusable when navigating the website using programs like [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org) or [Voice-over](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice-over). This effectively makes it impossible to pick a specified date and schedule a lesson. This extension tries to solve this issue and potentially many others in the future.

Any feedback and suggestions are greatly appreciated.

## installation

Since the extension is still in early development phase, the only possible way to install it is to clone this repository or download a zipped version from [here](https://github.com/SantiagoDePolonia/italki-accessibility-improvments/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and follow the instructions in [official chrome extension development guide](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted)
